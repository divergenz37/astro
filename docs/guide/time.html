<h2 id="solar-and-sidereal-time">Solar and sidereal time</h2>

<h3 id="solar-time">Solar time</h3>

<p>The <em>solar day</em> is measured based on the apparent movement of the Sun in the sky. Equivalently, it is based on the Earth’s rotation with respect to the Sun. When discussing solar time, we distinguish <em>apparent</em> and <em>mean</em> solar time.</p>

<p><em>Apparent solar time</em> is based on the position of the Sun in the sky, and corresponds to the hour angle of the Sun. <em>Apparent solar noon</em> occurs when the Sun is either directly north or south in the sky as seen by an observer, i.e. on the local meridian.<sup id="fnref:nist"><a href="#fn:nist" class="footnote">1</a></sup> When this occurs, the hour angle of the Sun is 0 h, and so is the apparent solar time. The time between two consecutive apparent solar noons is the <em>apparent solar day</em>. Sundials are an example of timekeeping based on apparent solar time, since they depend directly on the position of the Sun in the sky. However, the duration of the apparent solar day varies throughout the year. This poses issues for accurate timekeeping, since any divisions of time would also exhibit variations in duration.</p>

<p><em>Mean solar time</em>, in contrast, is based on the average duration of the solar day over a year. The duration of the <em>mean solar day</em> is about 86400 SI seconds. Because this value is fairly constant, clocks that tick at a constant rate follow mean solar time much more closely than they do apparent solar time. Nevertheless, there are still minor variations in the duration of the mean solar day over many years, due to effects such as the slowing of Earth’s rotation.</p>

<p><em>Civil time</em> is based on mean solar time, except that it is offset by 12 hours so that midnight corresponds to 0 h.</p>

<p>The variation in the length of the apparent solar day, as well as the interval between apparent and mean solar time, are discussed further in the subsection on the <a href="#equation-of-time">equation of time</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sidereal-time">Sidereal time</h3>

<p><em>Sidereal time</em> is measured based on the rotation of the Earth with respect to the vernal equinox, which is the point where the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator. The vernal equinox serves as the reference point for the equatorial coordinate system. <em>Local sidereal time</em> corresponds to the hour angle of the vernal equinox as measured by an observer. <em>Greenwich sidereal time</em> corresponds to this quantity, but measured at 0° longitude (the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) Reference Meridian). One also distinguishes <em>apparent sidereal time</em>, which is measured with respect to the ecliptic of the date and the true equator of the date (which includes nutation), while <em>mean sidereal time</em> is measured with respect to the ecliptic of the date and the mean equator of the date (which does not include nutation).</p>

<p>The <em>sidereal day</em> can be defined based on the time between two consecutive transits of the vernal equinox. Based on this definition, the duration of a sidereal day is 86164.09053 s (1.002737909350795 sidereal days in 86400 s)<sup id="fnref:aoki-1982"><a href="#fn:aoki-1982" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>On Earth, a sidereal day is shorter than a mean solar day.</p>

<p>While the vernal equinox serves as a convenient reference point, it is complicated by the fact that the Earth’s rotation axis slowly precesses with a period of about 26000 years. As a result of this, the vernal equinox is moving westward with respect to the fixed background stars. A true measurement of Earth’s rotation period should therefore eliminate this effect. Recently, accurate measurements of extremely distant quasars via Very Long Baseline Interferometry have allowed the implementation of the International Celestial Reference Frame, which measures the Earth Rotation Angle (ERA) with respect to these defined sources<sup id="fnref:iers"><a href="#fn:iers" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Under this system, the Earth’s rotation period is 86164.09890 s (1.00273781191135448 periods in 86400 s)<sup id="fnref:capitaine-2003"><a href="#fn:capitaine-2003" class="footnote">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:iers-tn"><a href="#fn:iers-tn" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. It is only about 8 ms longer than the sidereal day defined relative to the vernal equinox.</p>

<p><em>Universal Coordinated Time</em> (UTC)</p>

<h2 id="the-year">The year</h2>

<h2 id="julian-day">Julian Day</h2>

<h2 id="equation-of-time">Equation of time</h2>

<p>As previously mentioned in the subsection on <a href="#solar-time">solar time</a>, apparent solar time is not a uniform time scale, and the length of the apparent solar day is variable.</p>

<p>The main reasons for this difference are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Earth has an elliptical orbit around the Sun, causing the angular speed of the Sun to vary throughout the course of the year (see <a href="gravitation#keplers-second-law">Kepler’s second law</a> for more details). Smaller variations are contributed by gravitational perturbations from the Moon and planets.</li>
  <li>the Earth’s axial tilt means that Sun travels along the ecliptic and not the celestial equator. Since right ascension is measured along the celestial equator, even if the Earth described a perfectly circular orbit, i.e. the Sun travels along the ecliptic at a uniform speed, the right ascension of the Sun would not increase uniformly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meeus defines the concept of a <em>mean Sun</em> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider a first fictitious Sun travelling along the <em>ecliptic</em> with a constant speed and coinciding with the true Sun at the perigee and apogee (when the Earth is in perihelion and aphelion, respectively). Then consider a second fictitious Sun travelling along the <em>celestial equator</em> at a constant speed and coinciding with the first fictitious Sun at the equinoxes. This second fictitious Sun is the <em>mean Sun</em>, and by definition its right ascension increases at a uniform rate – that is, there are no periodic terms, but its expression contains small secular terms in <span class="kdmath">$\tau^2$</span>, <span class="kdmath">$\tau^3$</span>, …<sup id="fnref:meeus-1998"><a href="#fn:meeus-1998" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
