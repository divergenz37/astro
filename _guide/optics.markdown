### Interference and diffraction

### Rayleigh criterion
Telescopes and other tools we use for observation (including the eye) have circular openings or apertures. The finite size of these openings means that diffraction of incoming light is inevitable, and therefore diffraction determines the theoretical best possible resolution that can be obtained.

For a circular aperture, the minimum angular distance between two point sources that can be distinguished from each other is approximately given by the Rayleigh criterion, which gives the angular distance at which the first diffraction minimum occurs:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sin{\theta} = 1.220 \frac{\lambda}{D}
\end{equation}
$$

In this formula, $$\theta$$ is the minimum angular resolution, $$\lambda$$ is the wavelength of light emitted by the point sources, and $$D$$ is the diameter of the circular aperture.

In practice, one may be able to distinguish point sources that are slightly closer than given by the Rayleigh criterion. Dawes' limit gives an approximation to the minimum angular resolution $$\theta$$ in arcseconds, for a telescope with aperture $$D$$ measured in inches:

$$
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{4.56}{D}
\end{equation}
$$
