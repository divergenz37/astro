## Solar and sidereal time

### Solar time
The *solar day* is measured based on the apparent movement of the Sun in the sky. Equivalently, it is based on the Earth's rotation with respect to the Sun. When discussing solar time, we distinguish *apparent* and *mean* solar time.

*Apparent solar time* is based on the *local apparent solar noon*, which occurs when the Sun is either directly north or south in the sky as seen by an observer, i.e. on the local meridian. The time between two consecutive local apparent solar noons is the *apparent solar day*. Sundials are based on apparent solar time, since their function directly depends on the position of the Sun in the sky. However, the duration of the apparent solar day varies throughout the year, which poses issues for accurate timekeeping, since any divisions of time would also exhibit variations in duration. 

*Mean solar time*, in contrast, is based on the average duration of the solar day over a year. The duration of the *mean solar day* is about 86400 SI seconds. Because this value is fairly constant, clocks that tick at a constant rate follow mean solar time much more closely than they do apparent solar time. Nevertheless, there are still minor variations in the duration of the *mean solar day* over many years, due to effects such as the slowing of Earth's rotation. 

The variation in the length of the apparent solar day, as well as the interval between apparent and mean solar time, are discussed further in the subsection on the [equation of time](#equation-of-time).

### Sidereal time
*Sidereal time* is measured based on the rotation of the Earth with respect to the fixed background stars. A *sidereal day* is the time between two consecutive transits of a fixed background star, i.e. the time taken for it to make a full rotation starting from and ending at the local meridian.

On Earth, a sidereal day is shorter than a mean solar day, lasting for only 86164.09053 s (1.002737909350795 sidereal days in 86400 s).

A modern definition of sidereal time is based on the position of the vernal equinox, which is the point where the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator. The vernal equinox serves as the reference point for the equatorial coordinate system. The sidereal day can be defined based on the time between two consecutive transits of the vernal equinox. 

*Local sidereal time* corresponds to the hour angle of the vernal equinox as measured by an observer. *Greenwich sidereal time* corresponds to this quantity, but measured at 0Â° longitude (the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) Reference Meridian).

One also distinguishes *apparent sidereal time*, which is measured with respect to the ecliptic of the date and the true equator of the date (which includes nutation), while *mean sidereal time* is measured with respect to the ecliptic of the date and the mean equator of the date (which does not include nutation). 

### Stellar time
The Earth's rotation axis slowly precesses with a period of about 26000 years. As a result, the vernal equinox is moving westward with respect to the fixed background stars. A true measurement of Earth's rotation period should therefore eliminate this effect. Recently, accurate measurements of extremely distant quasars via Very Long Baseline Interferometry have allowed the implementation of the International Celestial Reference Frame, which measures the Earth Rotation Angle (ERA) with respect to these defined sources. 

Under this system, the Earth's rotation period is the *stellar day*, and its duration is 86164.09890 s (1.00273781191135448 stellar days in 86400 s). It is only about 8 ms shorter than the sidereal day.
